## Approach

The methods taken were to get all routes working on the backend while doing preliminary work on the frontend. Once the backend routes were finished and working, we were able to full flesh out the front end with minimum changes needed to the backend. Different basic aspects of the front end were worked on first such as registration, signing in, and the user homepage. Then things like the search function, the about page, and each individual video's page were worked on. Near the end, adding the comments on each video and the related function were added, all while styling was applied to each part of the app as we progressed.
